                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p> My name is John Ho. I am 25 years old from Ohio. I decided to take a coding bootcamp to pursue a career in tech. I have always enjoyed tech related things. Some of my hobbies include video games, disc golf, and weightlifting. Fun fact about me is that I've built and upgraded my PC.</p>
