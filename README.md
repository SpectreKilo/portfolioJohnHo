## Description 

[John Ho's Portfolio](https://spectrekilo.github.io/portfolioJohnHo/)





## Usage 
This portfolio will be used to show previous work to future employers. It will be updated as I learn more in the bootcamp and to showcase my growth and abilities.
[Nav Bar Example](./assets/images/navbarExample.png)
[ul bullets removal](./assets/images/list%20bullet%20removal.png)
 I learned how to use CSS styling to remove the bullet points from the ul element. I also learned how to use the nav tag.


## Learning Points 


1. Learned how to apply what was taught in the first week of the bootcamp.
2. Applied flexbox to portfolio.
3. Learned how to properly link images.
